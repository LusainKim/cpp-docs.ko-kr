# 개체가 리소스 소유(RAII)
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../assembler/inline/includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Make sure that objects own resources.  This principle is also known as “resource acquisition is initialization” or “RAII.”  
  
## 예제  
 Pass every “new” object as a constructor argument to another named object that owns it \(almost always unique\_ptr\).  
  
```cpp  
void f() {  
  unique_ptr<widget> p( new widget(…) );  
  my_class x( new widget() );  
  …  
} // automatic destruction and deallocation for both widget objects  
  // automatic exception safety, as if “finally { p->dispose(); x.w.dispose(); }”  
  
```  
  
 Always immediately pass any new resource to another object that owns it.  
  
```cpp  
void g() {  
  other_class y( OpenFile() );  
  …  
} // automatic closing and release for file resource  
  // automatic exception safety, as if “finally { y.file.dispose(); }”  
  
```
