# 원격 자동화 스레드 모델
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../assembler/inline/includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Remote Automation supports both the single\-threaded and the apartment\-threaded models of COM.  On 32\-bit and 64\-bit platforms, which are all that Visual C\+\+ supports, the threading model should be set to "apartment." For more information on how and where to do this, see [Creating Programs That Use Remote Automation](../mfc/creating-programs-that-use-remote-automation.md).
