# TN036: CFormView와 AppWizard 및 ClassWizard 함께 사용
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../assembler/inline/includes/vs2017banner.md)]

This technical note described how to modify an AppWizard generated application so that it used a `CFormView` instead of the default `CView` as its main view class.  This is supported directly with this version of Visual C\+\+.
