# 루트 클래스: CObject
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../assembler/inline/includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Most of the classes in the Microsoft Foundation Class \(MFC\) Library are derived from a single base class at the root of the class hierarchy.  `CObject` provides a number of useful capabilities to all classes derived from it, with very low overhead.  For more information about `CObject` and its capabilities, see [Using CObject](../mfc/using-cobject.md).  
  
 [CObject](../mfc/reference/cobject-class.md)  
 The ultimate base class of most MFC classes.  Supports serializing data and obtaining run\-time information about a class.  
  
 [CRuntimeClass](../mfc/reference/cruntimeclass-structure.md)  
 Structure used to determine the exact class of an object at run time.
