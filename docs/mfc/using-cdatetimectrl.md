# CDateTimeCtrl 사용
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../assembler/inline/includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The date and time picker control \([CDateTimeCtrl](../mfc/reference/cdatetimectrl-class.md)\) implements an intuitive and recognizable method of entering or selecting a specific date.  The main interface of the control is similar in functionality to a combo box.  However, if the user expands the control, a month calendar control appears \(by default\), allowing the user to specify a particular date.  When a date is chosen, the month calendar control automatically disappears.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  To use both the **CDateTimePicker** and `CMonthCalCtrl` classes in your project, you must include AFXDTCTL.H, usually in your project's STDAFX.H file.
