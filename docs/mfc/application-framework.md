The core of the Microsoft Foundation Class \(MFC\) Library is an encapsulation of a large portion of the Windows API in C\+\+ form.  Library classes represent windows, dialog boxes, device contexts, common GDI objects such as brushes and pens, controls, and other standard Windows items.  These classes provide a convenient C\+\+ member function interface to the structures in Windows that they encapsulate.  For more about using these classes, see [Window Object Topics](../mfc/window-objects.md).  
  
 But the MFC Library also supplies a layer of additional application functionality built on the C\+\+ encapsulation of the Windows API.  This layer is a working application framework for Windows that provides most of the common user interface expected of programs for Windows, including toolbars, status bars, printing, print preview, database support, and ActiveX support.  [Using the Classes to Write Applications for Windows](../mfc/using-the-classes-to-write-applications-for-windows.md) explains the framework in detail.
