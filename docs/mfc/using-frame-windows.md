# 프레임 창 사용
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../assembler/inline/includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The MFC framework creates document frame windows — and their views and documents — as part of its implementation of the New and Open commands on the File menu.  Because the framework does most of the frame\-window work for you, you play only a small role in creating, using, and destroying those windows.  You can, however, explicitly create your own frame windows and child windows for special purposes.
