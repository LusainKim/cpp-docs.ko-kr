# 창, 대화 상자 및 컨트롤 클래스
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../assembler/inline/includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Class `CWnd` and its derived classes encapsulate an `HWND`, a handle to a Windows window.  `CWnd` can be used by itself or as a base for deriving new classes.  The derived classes supplied by the class library represent various kinds of windows.  
  
 [CWnd](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md)  
 The base class for all windows.  You can use one of the classes derived from `CWnd` or derive your own classes directly from it.
